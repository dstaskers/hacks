Scripts and hacks for dstaskers

[dstask](https://github.com/naggie/dstask) is a git-backed command line
task management tool. It's scriptable, and outputs JSON if stdout is not
a terminal.

This repo is a place for the broader community to showcase useful scripts
to inspire others and inform the development of dstask.

## Criteria for Inclusion

Your hack should be relatively novel, or an improvement on an existing
hack.

Your hack should be broadly useful, not hyper-specific to your own usage.

## How to Contribute

Create a new directory with a unique name. That direcotory should include
your script(s) and a README with instructions on how to use them.
